## Bugs
There might be some bugs that would have crept in and went unnoticed while learning and developing, but main priority is to implement the functionality and designs agreed upon initially and these bugs would be fixed in coming updated versions/releases.

## Features

### Anime List
The [AnimeList](Abhi-AnimeX/app/src/main/java/com/abhijith/animex/ui/screens/animelist/AnimeList.kt) composable is the entry point to this screen.
This screen basically calls the [SeasonNow API](https://api.jikan.moe/v4/seasons/now) from [jikan](https://jikan.moe/) that displays current seasonal anime.

### Anime Details
The [AnimeDetails](Abhi-AnimeX/app/src/main/java/com/abhijith/animex/ui/screens/animedetails/AnimeDetails.kt) composable is the entry point to this screen.
This screen displays the details of the selected anime from Anime List screen. Before displaying the details, there is a user induced lottie animated [loading screen](Abhi-AnimeX/app/src/main/java/com/abhijith/animex/ui/screens/loading/LoadingScreen.kt) displayed to mimic an API call but the details are already present on List screen itself.

### UI tests
In [androidTest](Abhi-AnimeX/app/src/androidTest/java/com/abhijith/animex) you'll find a suite of UI tests that showcase interesting patterns in Compose:

#### [NavigationTest](Abhi-AnimeX/app/src/androidTest/java/com/abhijith/animex/NavigationTest.kt)
Shows how to write tests that assert directly on the [AppNavHost](Abhi-AnimeX/app/src/main/java/com/abhijith/animex/ui/navigation/AppNavHost.kt).
